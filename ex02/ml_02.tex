% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

The values of the second column are much smaller than the values of the first and third column. Scaling the data could compensate this problem affecting the euclidian distance.

This problem does not arise when training a decision tree since only one feature is considered for splitting the set at a time. Therefore, only the relative differences within each column are important.
